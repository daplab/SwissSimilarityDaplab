SwissSim -- Searching best-matching molecules at scale
====

If you ever thought about wiring [Spark](https://spark.apache.org) and [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org)
in a real-life project, this is for you. We do process 1 billion molecules stored
in a Cassandra cluster via Spark. And it works great!
