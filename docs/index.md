This project aims at providing a framework for searching unknown molecules against a database of know moledules.
Molecule fingerprints will be compared and sorted, and the most similar molecules will be returned.

The project will hopefully integrate into the portal [http://www.swisssimilarity.ch/](http://www.swisssimilarity.ch/).

[Get started](getting_started.md) and submit your first moledules to the [API](api.md)
